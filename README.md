Text Recognition using pytesseract

I have created a simple program to detect the text on any image using NLP. 
Work flow has been carried out in python language using openCV and pytesseract libraries.
First we need to download and install Pytesseract-OCR.exe file and install it in our environment, also we need ot specify its path in the program.
